# Gabbler #

Gabbler is a simple push-enabled chat application showcasing a modern and reactive web application: an interactive client based on [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) and a scalable and resilient RESTful server written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org), [Akka](http://akka.io) and [spray](http://spray.io).

For details check out the [Gabbler, a reactive chat app – part 1](http://hseeberger.github.io/blog/2013/07/08/gabbler-part1/) blog post and its follow-ups.

Huge thanks to Mathias Doenitz from the spray team for his help and contributions!

## Running Gabbler ##

Clone this repository, `cd` into it and start [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org). Then simply execute `run` to start the Gabbler server:

```
gabbler$ sbt
[info] ...
[info] Set current project to gabbler (in build file:/Users/heiko/projects/gabbler/)
> run
[info] Running name.heikoseeberger.gabbler.GabblerServerApp
```

Open a browser and point it to [localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). Use the same value for username and password, e.g. "John" and "John".

Enter a message in the text area on the left, click the "Gabble away" button and watch the message appear on the right.

Open a second browser window which needs to be a different application if you want to use a separate login (e.g. first Safari, second Chrome), enter another message and watch it appear in both browser windows.
