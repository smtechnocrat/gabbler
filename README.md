Gabbler
=======

Gabbler is a simple push-enabled chat application showcasing a modern and reactive web application: an interactive client based on [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) and a scalable and resilient RESTful server written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org), [Akka](http://akka.io) and [spray](http://spray.io).

For details check out the [Gabbler, a reactive chat app â€“ part 1](http://hseeberger.github.io/blog/2013/07/08/gabbler-part1/) blog post and its follow-ups.

Huge thanks to Mathias Doenitz from the spray team for his help and contributions!

Running Gabbler
---------------

Clone this repository, `cd` into it and start [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org). Then simply execute `run` to start the Gabbler server:

```
gabbler$ sbt
[info] ...
[info] Set current project to gabbler (in build file:/Users/heiko/projects/gabbler/)
> run
[info] Running name.heikoseeberger.gabbler.GabblerServerApp
Hit ENTER to exit ...
```

Open a browser and point it to [localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). Use the same value for username and password, e.g. "John" and "John".

Enter a message in the text area on the left, click the "Gabble away" button and watch the message appear on the right.

Open a second browser window which needs to be a different application if you want to use a separate login (e.g. first Safari, second Chrome), enter another message and watch it appear in both browser windows.

Finally, hit the ENTER key in the sbt session to stop the Gabbler server.
